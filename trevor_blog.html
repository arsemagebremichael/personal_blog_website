                <p>Reading the book again after three years, I have more questions, more insignts on Apartheid than I
                    had reading
                    it for the first time. In the book club I was participating, I was asked what I would name it if I
                    was given the chance to name it, it would be "Color Blind: Not confied by it" </p>

                </div>
                <p>Trevor Noah's book has opened my eyes to how apartheid was and continues to exist though its legacy
                    across South Africa. I chose the title "Color Blind: Not confined by it" to express the resilience
                    and
                    motivation of Trevor to go beyond what was "set" by the world for him even before he came to earth.
                    The
                    title I chose also reflects Patricia's resilience on gender-based generational trauma, her not
                    submitting to limited patriarchal norms. It contains their shared determination to go beyond the
                    barriers set by a society before they were even born.</p>

                <h2>Quote Reflection</h2>
                <div class="quote">

                    <p> "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                        traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                        who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class='reflections'>

                    There is a saying that goes, "Human desires often only become clear when encountered the opposite of
                    what we are looking for." Unfortunately for Patricia, Abel's pursuit of "fire", a woman of ambition,
                    goals and that goes beyond the norms masked his actual desire for "water", a traditional woman who
                    follows gender roles, that is submissive to her husband. This narrative opens our eyes to a broader
                    societal tension on gender inequalities and gender roles, a dynamic that still exists across
                    cultures
                    even in progressive societies where men supposedly identify as "woke", "civilized", or "feminist".
                    Beneath these labels, a persistent need for male superiority is observed revealing the contradiction
                    stated above.
                    Societal expectations put a heavy blanket of burden on women, demanding them to exceed the men in
                    work
                    place just to earn "respect", and equal treatment, and as if this is not enough, woman
                    simultaneously
                    are expected to manage the household responsibilities of maintaining the household, raising
                    children,
                    catering to her husband's needs and expect her to still have time to care for herself. On the
                    contrary,
                    men often get praised for minimum effort such as putting the dishes away, which society frames as
                    "helping his wife" rather than sharing responsibilities. This basically reflects the double standard
                    we
                    as a society share towards women. </p>
                <p class='reflections'>
                    Freud's concept of "penis envy", a metaphor suggests women envy men "societal freedom." This
                    addresses
                    the inequalities on gender roles and it requires getting rid of our norms and bringing a culture in
                    which both share responsibilities and are accountable. Only through a continuous effort can
                    societies
                    across cultures move more towards an actual gender equity, challenging the imposed structure of
                    women
                    and men gender role gaps.
